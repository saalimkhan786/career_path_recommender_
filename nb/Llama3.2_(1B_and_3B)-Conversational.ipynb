              " {'content': \"Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. It breaks down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable subproblems until a base case is reached. The base case is a condition where the function does not call itself, but instead returns a specific value or performs a specific action.\\n\\nIn the case of calculating the factorial of a number, recursion can be used to break down the problem into simpler subproblems. The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.\\n\\nHere is a recursive function in Python that calculates the factorial of a given number:\\n\\n```python\\ndef factorial(n):\\n    # Base case: factorial of 0 or 1 is 1\\n    if n == 0 or n == 1:\\n        return 1\\n    # Recursive case: factorial of n is n multiplied by factorial of (n-1)\\n    else:\\n        return n * factorial(n - 1)\\n```\\n\\nIn this function, the base case is when n equals 0 or 1, as the factorial of these numbers is defined as 1. For any other positive integer, the function calls itself with a smaller value (n-1) and multiplies the result by n.\\n\\nFor example, let's calculate the factorial of 5 using this function:\\n\\n```python\\nprint(factorial(5))\\n```\\n\\nThe function will execute as follows:\\n1. factorial(5) calls factorial(4) and multiplies the result by 5.\\n2. factorial(4) calls factorial(3) and multiplies the result by 4.\\n3. factorial(3) calls factorial(2) and multiplies the result by 3.\\n4. factorial(2) calls factorial(1) and multiplies the result by 2.\\n5. factorial(1) is a base case and returns 1.\\n6. The final result is calculated as: 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 1\",\n",
